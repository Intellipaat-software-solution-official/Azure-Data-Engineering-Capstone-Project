Similar to an IPL cricket English Premier League football or NFL Formula One season happens once a year, roughly over 20 races.

Each race happens over a weekend.

Obviously there are various race **circuits** on which the races takes place.
Usually there is only one race in a circuit each year, but due to the COVID outbreak in 2020, there were more than one race conducted in some of the circuits.

There are roughly ten teams that participate in each season and they are also called **constructors** in Formula One.

Each team has two **drivers** and each driver is assigned a specific car.

Raceway can spans from Friday to Sunday.
There are two practice sessions on a Friday and a final practice session on Saturday morning. They don't count towards any points or achievements.

There is a **qualifying** session on Saturday afternoon and it happens over three different stages. The qualifying results decide the grid position of the driver as to where he'll start the race.

The higher the driver qualifies the forward, he gets to start the race, which is a massive advantage. Unlike qualifying sessions, which are decided over a single **lap**, races span multiple laps, roughly between 50 and 70 laps, depending on the length of the circuit.

Also during the race, drivers make **pit stops** to change the tires or to replace the damaged car.

**Based on the race results. Drivers and constructors standings are decided. Whichever driver is on the top of the standings at the end of the season is the drivers champion.
And similarly, the team that's leading the constructors standings becomes the Constructors champion.**

Hope this gives you a good understanding about Formula One and the various terminologies used.
We're only going to be dealing with the data that's focused on these concepts.
